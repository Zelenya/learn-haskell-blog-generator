# Building an HTML printer library

In this part, we'll explore a few basic building blocks in Haskell,
including functions, types, and modules, while building a small HTML printer library
with which we will later construct HTML pages from our markup blog posts.

If you're not familiar with HTML and would like a quick tutorial before diving in, MDN's
[Getting started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)
is a good overview of the subject.
